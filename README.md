# Tracefront

Real-time AI decision support for food safety incidents. See [tracefront_project_summary.md](tracefront_project_summary.md) for the full spec.

## Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)

```
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # point DATABASE_URL at your Postgres instance
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs. Tables are created automatically on startup from `app/models.py` (matches the ERD in section 14 of the project summary).

Endpoints:
- `GET /api/health`
- `GET /api/batches`, `POST /api/batches`
- `POST /api/sensor-readings`, `POST /api/lab-results`
- `GET /api/batches/{id}/trace` — upstream/downstream via `app/graph.py` (NetworkX)
- `GET /api/shipments/{id}/risk` — rule-based priority score (`app/risk.py`); swap for a trained XGBoost/GBM model later

## Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)

```
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Dashboard at http://localhost:3000, lists batches from the API and shows API health.

## Not built yet

Decision engine, ML risk model training, Cytoscape graph visualization (dependency is in `package.json`, no component yet), human-approval flow. Per the project summary, don't build these until the batch → trace → risk → dashboard flow above works end to end.
